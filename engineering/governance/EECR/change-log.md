| Summary | MWP-001 migration of all DAEP / RE-OS engineering foundation governance artefacts from the temporary `RE-OS` local repository to the canonical `github.com/emmanoff-sys/diep-lab` repository, per ADR-007. Artefacts migrated: `engineering/governance/EECR/` (11 files, EECR v1.0, EECR-CHG-001 through EECR-CHG-007), `STANDARDS.md` (WP-001-02), `CODEOWNERS` (WP-001-01), `.editorconfig` (WP-001-01), `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (WP-001-02), `LICENSE` (WP-001-01). `README.md` updated with Engineering Governance section (additive — existing DIEP product content preserved). Artefacts not migrated: `.gitignore` (diep-lab version retained as more comprehensive), `.github/` workflow stubs (diep-lab has real CI workflows), `apps/`/`services/`/`libs/`/`infra/`/`docs/` placeholder stubs (diep-lab has its own directory structure). All Work Package IDs, EECR IDs, ADR references, Epic numbering, branch names, and architecture baseline references preserved without modification. Temporary `RE-OS` repository is now eligible for archival. All ongoing development continues in `diep-lab`. |

| Summary | WP-001-03 (Documentation Framework) implemented. Created `docs/README.md` (navigable documentation index covering architecture baseline pointers, ADR directory, operational docs, and engineering governance). Created `docs/architecture/` with seven pointer files — one per Architecture Baseline document: `brs.md` (BRS v1.0), `srs.md` (SRS v1.0), `hld.md` (HLD v2.0, with HLD v1.0 superseded notice per ECR-005), `lld.md` (LLD v2.0), `uiux-spec.md` (UI/UX Spec v1.0), `roadmap.md` (Roadmap v1.0), `drdp.md` (DRDP v1.0). Each pointer file records Document Type, Reference ID, Version, Status, Classification, Parent Documents, Superseded By, one-paragraph purpose, source location note, and cross-references. Created `docs/adr/README.md` (ADR directory index, lifecycle guide, ADR template, ECR log note). Root `README.md` updated additively — three rows added to Engineering Governance table linking to docs/README.md, docs/architecture/, and docs/adr/README.md. No application code modified; existing `docs/` operational content (OMS modules, runbooks, release docs) untouched. WP-001-03 status changed from READY to IN PROGRESS (pending AR-003). |

Created `.bandit`: HIGH severity = build failure; B101 (assert) skipped for test files; suppression policy requiring Bandit test ID on every `# nosec` comment. Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: added Ruff (rev v0.4.9, ruff + ruff-format hooks), mypy (rev v1.10.0, strict + ignore-missing-imports), Bandit (rev 1.7.9, targeting src/ and templates/ Python files). STANDARDS.md §2.1 extended: mypy strict-mode flag table documenting all active checks; Bandit severity policy table (HIGH = build failure); suppression policies for both tools. `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.bandit]` sections already in root pyproject.toml. WP title corrected from "Terraform/Ansible Coding Standards" to "Static Analysis". SP corrected from 3 to 5 per WP §38. |

| Author | Platform Lead (AI-assisted: claude-sonnet-4-6) |
| Summary | WP-001-08 (Dependency Policy) implemented on batch branch `feature/wp-001-08-11-foundation-batch`. Created `DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md` covering the exact-pin requirement (== operator; floating ranges only in requirements.in), pip-compile + pip-sync + pip-audit workflow, CVE scanning policy (any known CVE = PR blocked), CVE exception process (ECR + Security Lead sign-off + 90-day expiry), upgrade procedure, JavaScript (npm ci + npm audit) and Flutter (pubspec.lock) policies. Created `templates/python-service/requirements.in` (runtime deps mirroring pyproject.toml [project].dependencies) and `templates/python-service/requirements.txt` (representative exact-pinned output with header directing regeneration via pip-compile in a clean Python 3.11 environment). Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: added pip-audit hook (pypa/pip-audit rev v2.7.3) targeting templates/python-service/requirements.txt; corrected WP-001-08 planning-comment scope from "detect-secrets, pip-audit, licence compliance" to "Dependency CVE scanning (pip-audit)" per actual WP. WP-001-08 status updated from NOT STARTED to IN PROGRESS (pending AR-008). |

Build-reproducibility requirement documented (exact-pin + lock-file + Python 3.11 enforced). CI stage mapping table included. Service renaming procedure (scaffold template → actual service) documented. Updated `templates/python-service/pyproject.toml`: replaced setuptools backend (`requires = ["setuptools>=72.0"]`, `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`) with hatchling backend (`requires = ["hatchling"]`, `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["src/service_name"]`) per WP-001-09 §15 (PEP 621-native, single backend policy for all Python components).

| Author | Platform Lead (AI-assisted: claude-sonnet-4-6) |
| Summary | WP-001-11 (Artifact Repository) implemented. Created `ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY.md`: pypiserver as the Python package index (PEP 503 Simple Repository API, twine upload); Release 1 scope (Docker Compose local/CI only); publish workflow (pip-audit CVE gate before publish; twine upload to localhost:8080); consume workflow (pip install --index-url); authentication via .htpasswd + ~/.netrc for Release 1; access log guidance (docker compose logs, forward to WP-002-07 post-EPIC-003); production promotion path (Ansible role after WP-003-05/06/07); future npm registry note (Verdaccio, separate WP); full traceability table. Created `infra/artifact-repo/docker-compose.yml`: pypiserver/pypiserver v2.3.2 pinned image; port 8080; ./packages and ./.htpasswd volumes; authenticate update (upload requires auth, download is open within internal network); healthcheck. Created `infra/artifact-repo/.gitignore`: gitignores .htpasswd (credentials) and packages/ (runtime data). WP-001-11 status updated from NOT STARTED to IN PROGRESS (pending AR-011). |
